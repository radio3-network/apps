# apps

Apps available for install inside the blumchen operating system.

Radio3.network provides a centralized location for installing and submitting apps that run inside radio3-compatible devices. It should be noted that each community/group can host their own apps outside of this centralized resource. To enable decentralization, these apps are placed inside folders that follow a template of files and folders that are expected inside.

Template for each published app:

+ Unique name
+ Full name
+ Logo image
+ One-line description
+ Version
+ Screenshots
+ Author credits
+ Summary
+ Additional install instructions
+ Contact
+ Support link
+ Tags
+ Translations
+ License (including 3rd-party)
+ Compatible models
+ Necessary sensors/modules
+ Compatible API versions
+ Compilable source code
+ Compilable libraries
+ Compiled binaries

An explanation for using these fields is provided on the sections ahead.

The following rules apply:

+ Each app has a unique folder on the repository root.
+ Each version of the app has its own folder with the same template structure.
+ The central app library uses English as main language, for you app to be included you need to include an english translation.
Apps support multiple languages and versions.
